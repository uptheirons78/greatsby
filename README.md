This project is based on one of my Gatsby Repo: "gatsby-markdown-blog".

#### step-01
* Install gatsby-source-contentful;
* Create .env file and add Gatsby Api Keys;
* Add the plugin inside "gatsby-config" [with options];
* Add a fake placeholder image inside Contentful Media to avoid GraphQL issues;
* Add /pages/contentful.js to display all blog posts from Contentful;
* create a query with "allContentfulBlogPost" and render a list of posts;
